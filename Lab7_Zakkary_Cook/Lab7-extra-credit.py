'''
In a program you can simulate a magic square using a two-dimensional list.
Write a function that accepts a two-dimensional list as an arguement and
determines whether the list is a Lo Shu Magic Square.

The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly.
The sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same
number.
