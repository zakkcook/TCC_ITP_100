'''
Write a program that generates a random number in the range of 1 through
100, and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess
is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try
again." If the user guesses the number, the application should congratulate
the user and generate a new random number so the game can start over.
