in mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. the 
factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. for example, 
7! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 5,040 and 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24. write a program that lets
the user enter a nonnegative integer then uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that 
number. display the factorial.
